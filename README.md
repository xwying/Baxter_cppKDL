# Baxter cppKDL
A Kinematic Solver for Baxter Robot that written in C++.

# Introduction
Baxter cppKDL is a C++ library that offers forward kinematics and inverse kinematic calculation. We got inspired by [Baxter_pyKDL](http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Baxter_PyKDL) and aimed to reduce the difficuty of solving kinematics in C++.

# Prerequisite
This library uses functions in orocos KDL(Kinematics and Dynamics Library), thus this package has to be installed. Please see [http://www.orocos.org/kdl/installation-manual] for more information.

This is also our first ROS project. If you have any problem please feel free to contact sslf[at]foxmail[dot]com or ybfan910[at]163[dot]com
